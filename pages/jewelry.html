                <h1 class="title">Jewelry Ecommerce Website</h1>
                <p class="context">Designed and developed a mock product website for selling South-Asian jewelry,
                    completed during a
                    class at SFU for Web Development and Design. This project was done in a team of two with Lina
                    Dang-Nguyen.</p>
                <p class="context">Coming from a computer science background, my personal goal for this project was to
                    combine my skill
                    in programming with my passion for design.</p>

                <p class="code-text">The goal of the project was to create a responsive ecommence site for any fictional
                    company of choice. When brainstorming art directions and company ideas, I came up with the idea to
                    create a website that sells South-Asian jewelry as I noticed a lack of trendy and chic website
                    designs for Indian jewelry. A lot of websites on the current web were dated and lacked a cohesive
                    design.</p>

                    <p class="code-text">There were many challenges that came when designing the UI and making design
                        aesthetic
                        decisions. I wanted the keep the site simple and modern which is challenging as
                        Indian
                        jewelry is very extravagant, colourful and traditional. To work with this contrast, I made sure
                        UI
                        elements took from both the traditional and modern side. For example, the main body font of the website is simple and modern
                        but
                        its
                        paired with traditional indian bridal colours (dark red and gold). Below is the style guide I
                        created for some of the design elements.

                    <p class="code-text">This was my first time working with responsive web design techniques where I
                        quickly
                        learned the importance of starting responsive. Some initial designs and layouts looked great in
                        Figma
                        and on a large screen size, but when taking a small mobile screen into consideration, the design
                        was
                        not
                        an efficient use of space. Due to this, my teammate and I had to refactor some design decisions
                        to
                        allow
                        for a more seamless transition between screen sizes. Below is my product page design for different screen sizes.

                <p class="code-text">I previously had some experience with CSS media queries, but when I used them my
                    websites had harsh transitions between screen sizes. For this project, I learned how to
                    effectively
                    use CSS media queries in combination with adaptive layouts. I was able to have my layouts gradually
                    scale with the screen to allow for a more fluid website. Below, is a video of my product page
                    layout I developed,
                    where you can see a smooth transition between responsive breakpoints.

            <h3 class="sub-title highlight4">Combining Development with Design</h3>
            <p class="code-text">With a strong computer science background, I usually donâ€™t combine the coding and
                design aspect of my projects, I usually focus on one at a time. During this project, I got to
                experience
                combining both the design and code simultaneously. 
                After completing this project, I'm more confident in my web development
                and design skills. I learned how important responsive web design is and how to more efficiently create web applications.
