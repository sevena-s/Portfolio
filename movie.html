                <p>As part of a semester long team project for an animation course, we were tasked with creating an original animated short film.</p>
                <p>Our final animated story centers around a man barely surviving alone in the desert. One day he finds a berry tree but it is guarded by a magical fire creature! The man must figure out how to get the berries to survive.</p>

            <h1>3D Modeling</h1>
            <p>After creating our script and pitching our storyboard, we began modeling our characters and environment. My main role for this project was to model the environment and some features on the main character. Through this, I gained experience using professional animation techniques such as rigging and working with lighting the environment.</p>

        <div class="proposal">
            <h1>Animation</h1>
            <p>With the models and environment ready, our next task was animating the film. For this part we equally split up the scenes so we each fully animated a different part of the story. My part was animating the beginning which involved multipled different angles. </p>
