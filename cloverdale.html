                <h1 class="title">Cloverdale Paint UI/UX Design</h1>
                <p>In collabration with Cloverdale Paint, our goal was to design a technological solution for the
                    Cloverdale Paint website.</p>
                <p>Through UX research, we designed and prototyped a Product Selection Wizard to enhance the
                    online shopping experience for our target audience.</p>

            <h1>Research</h1>
            <p>To start, we needed to narrow down an area within the company where we could improve the user experience.
                Through interviews with Cloverdale Paint employees and online research, we found that their customer
                base is mostly contractors. Only 5-10% of customers are DIY painters even though they are main users of
                the Cloverdale Paint website.</p>
            <p>So how can we improve the online shopping experience for DIY customers? To get a better understanding of
                our target audience, we created a persona and journery map.</p>

        <div class="proposal">
            <h1>Design Proposal</h1>
            <p>Based on our research, our design proposal was a Product Selection Wizard. A digital experience that
                walks the user through the process of selecting the appropriate paint, primer, and tools for a specific
                project based on the space they will be working in, what type of surface they will be painting on, and
                which colour they have selected. We included a more explorative colour picker as users find choosing a
                colour the most fun part</p>
        </div>

        <div class="prototype">
            <h1>User Workshop & Prototype</h1>
            <p>Before finalizing our prototype, we conducted a workshop with DIY customers to explore users concerns and
                goals for online paint shopping. Based on the feedback from our 11 particpates and our initial research,
                we designed our prototype on Figma. </p>
