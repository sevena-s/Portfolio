                <p>In collabration with Cloverdale Paint, our goal was to design a technological solution for the Cloverdale Paint wbesite.</p>
                <p>Through UX research, we designed and prototyped a Product Selection Wizard to enhance the onlineshopping experience for our target audience</p>

        <div class="research">
            <h1>Research</h1>
            <p>To start, we needed to narrow down an area within the company where we could improve the user experience. Through interviews with Cloverdale Paint employees and online research, we found that their customer base is mostly contractors. Only 5-10% of customers are DIY painters even though they are main users of the Cloverdale Paint website.</p>
            <p>So how can we improve the online shopping experience for DIY customers? To get a better understanding of our target audience, we created a persona and journery map.</p>

        <div class="proposal">
            <h1>Design Proposal</h1>
            <p>Based on our research, our design proposal was a Product Selection Wizard. A digital experience that walks the user through the process of selecting the appropriate paint, primer, and tools for a specific project based on the space they will be working in, what type of surface they will be painting on, and which colour they have selected. We included a more explorative colour picker as users find choosing a color the most fun part</p>

        <div class="prototype">
            <h1>User Workshop & Prototype</h1>
            <p>Before finalizing our prototype, we conducted a workshop with DIY customers to explore users concerns and goals for online paint shopping. Based on the feedback from our 11 particpates and our initial research, we designed our prototype on Figma. </p>
